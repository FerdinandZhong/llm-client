This fear can be due to various reasons such as fear of retribution, fear of being seen as insubordinate, fear of losing one's job, or fear of being ostracized by colleagues. As a South African female employee in a mid-sized company, I have witnessed this phenomenon firsthand, and it can hinder open communication, creativity, and productivity in the workplace.""
