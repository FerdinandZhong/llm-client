Explanation:

As a 35-year-old woman born and raised in China, currently working in a medium-sized company in Shanghai, I believe that ""节制：没有多少欲望"" (frugality: having few desires) is quite important for me. This is because frugality allows me to prioritize my needs over my wants, and to save money and resources for more important goals and expenses.

For instance, by living a simple life and avoiding unnecessary spending, I can save money for my children's education, retirement, and unexpected emergencies. Additionally, frugality helps me to avoid debt and maintain a good credit score, which is crucial in today's economy.

Moreover, having few desires also helps me to stay focused on my career and personal goals, without being distracted by material possessions or unnecessary indulgences. It allows me to cultivate a sense of contentment and gratitude for what I already have, rather than constantly striving for more.

By  taking  care  of  our  mental  health,  we  can  improve  our

This is because, in Japanese culture, the concept of ""giri"" (obligation) and ""on"" (face-saving) are deeply ingrained in our social norms. We are taught from a young age to prioritize building relationships and fostering a sense of community, and being generous and helpful towards others is seen as a vital part of this.

Moreover, in a workplace setting, helping others and being willing to lend a hand not only strengthens personal relationships but also contributes to a positive and productive work environment. It promotes teamwork, collaboration, and mutual respect among colleagues, which are essential for achieving success in a competitive business landscape.

Therefore, I believe that ""帮助朋友，慷慨大方"" (helping friends, being generous and open-hearted) is not only important but also a valuable asset for personal and professional growth in Japanese culture.","{

I somewhat agree with the statement that a good manager does not have to provide precise answers to every question from subordinates regarding work. As a manager, it's important to understand that not every question has a clear-cut answer, and sometimes it's necessary to explore different possibilities and perspectives.

That being said, it's also important for a manager to have a good understanding of the work being done by their subordinates and to be able to provide guidance and support when needed. A good manager should be able to ask the right questions, spot potential issues, and help their team members find solutions.

While it's important for a manager to have a strong understanding of the work and be able to provide guidance, it's not realistic or necessary for them to have all the answers.
