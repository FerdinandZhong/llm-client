As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings. However, I can provide a response based on general trends and cultural norms in India.
In India, family and work obligations often take priority over leisure time. However, with changing times and an increasing awareness of work-life balance, keeping time free for fun is becoming more important for many people, especially for younger generations.
According to a recent survey conducted by LinkedIn, work-life balance is one of the top considerations for Indian professionals when choosing a job, with 70% of respondents saying they prioritize it over salary and other benefits. Additionally, the growing startup culture in India has led to a shift towards more flexible work arrangements, giving employees more control over their time.
That being said, individual priorities and circumstances can vary greatly. Some people may place a higher value on keeping time free for fun due to personal interests or hobbies, while others may prioritize work or family obligations.
So, in response to your question, I can provide a general answer based on the above information:
