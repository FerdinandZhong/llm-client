However, I can provide you with some general information about thrift in Chinese culture.
In traditional Chinese culture, thrift is highly valued and regarded as a virtue. It is believed that thriftiness helps to conserve resources, avoid waste, and achieve financial stability. Many Chinese people believe that ""节约是致富之母"" (jié yuē shì fù zhī mǔ), which translates to ""thrift is the mother of wealth.""
That being said, individual attitudes towards thrift can vary depending on personal experiences, values, and circumstances. Some people may place a higher value on thrift than others.
I hope this information is helpful.
