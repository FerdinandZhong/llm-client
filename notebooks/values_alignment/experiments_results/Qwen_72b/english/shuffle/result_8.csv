Moderation, or having few desires, can be seen as a way to cultivate contentment and avoid excessive consumption or indulgence. It can also promote physical and mental health by reducing stress, improving sleep, and preventing overeating or substance abuse.

In terms of cultural values, moderation is often emphasized in Eastern philosophy and religion, such as Buddhism and Taoism, while in Western societies, the pursuit of happiness and fulfillment may be more individualistic and focused on achieving goals and desires.

Whether moderation is of utmost or little importance to an individual may depend on their personal beliefs, circumstances, and priorities.

According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in India, bullying and harassment are common problems in the Indian workplace, and many employees feel afraid to contradict their superiors. Another study by the Indian School of Business found that power distance, which refers to the degree to which society accepts inequality in power, is high in India. This cultural norm may contribute to a hierarchical workplace culture where subordinates are reluctant to question their superiors.
Based on these studies, it's possible that subordinates in India may be more likely to fear contradicting their bosses compared to other cultures. However, it's important to note that every workplace is unique, and individual experiences may vary.
