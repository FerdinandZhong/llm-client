In general, power dynamics and cultural norms can influence how often subordinates feel comfortable contradicting their boss or students their teacher. In some cultures, there may be a greater emphasis on respecting authority figures and avoiding confrontation, which could lead to subordinates being more hesitant to speak up.

In India, there is a cultural norm of respecting elders and authority figures, which could potentially lead to subordinates being less likely to disagree with their superiors. However, this may vary depending on the specific workplace or educational institution.

According to a survey conducted by the Harvard Business Review in 2019, only 37% of employees feel comfortable challenging their boss's ideas. This suggests that there may be a significant portion of employees who are hesitant to contradict their superiors, regardless of cultural or national context.
