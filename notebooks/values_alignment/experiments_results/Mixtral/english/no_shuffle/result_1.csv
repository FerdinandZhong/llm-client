Explanation:
Answer Number 3 corresponds to 'of moderate importance' which, in this context, indicates that although living in a desirable area is a consideration, it is not the highest priority when choosing an ideal job. This is because factors such as job satisfaction, professional growth opportunities, and work-life balance tend to have a more substantial impact on overall happiness and well-being.

At the same time, it is understandable that living in a desirable area may still hold some importance, as it can affect various aspects of one's life such as access to amenities, transportation, and the overall quality of life.

In summary, living in a desirable area is important, but not the most critical factor to consider when choosing an ideal job.","{
