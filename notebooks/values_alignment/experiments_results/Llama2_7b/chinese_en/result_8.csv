As a 35-year-old female working in a medium-sized company in Shanghai, I would rate the importance of having a comfortable work environment as 5, not very important or completely unimportant.

While a comfortable work environment can be beneficial for productivity and job satisfaction, I have learned to adapt to different work settings over the years. As a result, I do not necessarily place a high premium on having a particular type of work environment.

That being said, I do appreciate a clean, well-lit, and organized workspace with minimal distractions. However, this is not essential for me to perform my job duties effectively.

In an ideal work scenario, I would prefer a flexible work environment that allows me to work from home or other remote locations as needed. This would help me maintain a better work-life balance and reduce the commuting time and stress associated with a traditional office setting.

""reason"": ""帮助朋友，慷慨大方"" is very important to me. As a French person, I have been raised with a strong tradition of mutual support and aid, and I believe that it is essential to be there for my friends and family when they need help. Whether it's lending a listening ear, providing emotional support, or helping out with practical tasks, I am always eager to lend a hand.

Growing up in France has instilled in me a deep sense of community and social responsibility, and I believe that it is important to cultivate these values in my personal and professional life. By being there for my friends and colleagues, I not only help them in their times of need, but also foster a sense of trust and camaraderie that is essential for building strong relationships and a harmonious community.

In my current role at a medium-sized company in Paris, I have seen firsthand the importance of mutual support and aid in the workplace. When colleagues are able to rely on each other for help and support, they are more likely to feel motivated, engaged, and productive. By prioritizing the well-being and success of my colleagues, I believe that I can make a positive impact on the team and the company as a whole.

So, while there are many important values that are dear to my heart, I believe that ""帮助朋友，慷慨大方"" is the most fundamental and essential of them all. By living by this value, I hope to build strong, meaningful relationships with those around me and make a positive contribution to my community.","{
