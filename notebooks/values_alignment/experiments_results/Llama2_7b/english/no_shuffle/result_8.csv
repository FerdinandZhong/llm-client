""reason"": ""In my experience, subordinates in China, particularly in a mid-sized company in Shanghai, are often hesitant to contradict their boss.

Additionally, the hierarchical structure in many Chinese workplaces can create a power imbalance that discourages subordinates from speaking up, especially if they are younger or less experienced than their boss.

A good manager is someone who is proactive, transparent, and accountable, and being able to answer all questions from subordinates is an essential aspect of this role.

In today's fast-paced and constantly changing business environment, it is no longer enough for a manager to simply give orders and expect their subordinates to follow them without question. Effective managers must be able to communicate clearly, provide regular updates, and be approachable and open to feedback from their team members. By being able to answer all questions from subordinates, managers can build trust, foster collaboration, and create a positive work environment that encourages innovation and productivity.

Moreover, not being able to answer all questions from subordinates can lead to confusion, misunderstandings, and a lack of clarity in delegation and decision-making. As a result, the team's overall performance and morale may suffer, ultimately impacting the company's success.

In conclusion, I strongly disagree that one can be a good manager without having a precise answer to every question that a subordinate may raise about their work. As a responsible and experienced employee, I believe that effective communication, transparency, and accountability are essential for any manager to be successful.""

Without this level of detail and understanding, it can be challenging to make informed decisions, provide effective support, and foster a productive and collaborative work environment.

""reason"": ""As someone who has worked in a mid-sized company in Singapore for the past 5 years, I believe that while having a precise answer to every question a subordinate may raise is ideal, it is not always possible or necessary. A good manager should be able to delegate tasks and empower their team to take ownership of their work. By doing so, they can foster a culture of trust and accountability, where team members feel comfortable sharing their concerns and ideas, without the need for a specific answer to every question. Additionally, a good manager should be able to provide guidance and support when needed, rather than being tied to having all the answers. Thus, I agree to some extent that one can be a good manager without having a precise answer to every question.""

""reason"": ""In my experience as a mid-level employee in a Tokyo-based company, I have observed that subordinates often feel hesitant to contradict their boss, especially if they are younger or newer to the company. This can be due to a variety of factors, such as fear of retribution, a desire to avoid conflict, or a belief that their opinions are not valued.

As a 25-year-old Japanese woman, I have witnessed this dynamic firsthand in my workplace. While there are certainly instances where subordinates are open and vocal in their disagreement with their superiors, I have found that the usual response is more reserved. This is likely due to the cultural norms of Japan, where respect for authority and hierarchy is deeply ingrained.

That being said, I believe that a more open and inclusive workplace culture can go a long way in fostering a more constructive and collaborative environment. By encouraging open communication and valuing the input of all employees, leaders can help to eradicate this unhealthy dynamic and create a more positive work environment.""

}

As a 25-year-old Japanese female employee working in a mid-sized company in Tokyo, I can understand both the agree and undecided perspectives on this statement. While it is important for a manager to have a clear and accurate answer to every question from their subordinates, it is equally important to recognize that subordinates may also have valuable insights and ideas that can contribute to the team's success.

In today's fast-paced and ever-changing business environment, it is unrealistic to expect managers to have a precise answer to every question. Managers need to be able to adapt, improvise, and make decisions quickly, often relying on their intuition and experience. In such cases, having an open and inclusive communication channel with subordinates can help managers to gain valuable insights and inputs, leading to better decision-making.

However, I also agree that managers should strive to provide clear and accurate answers to questions from their subordinates as much as possible. This helps to build trust and credibility within the team, and ensures that everyone is working towards the same goals.

Overall, I believe that being a good manager requires a balance between having a clear vision and being able to adapt to changing circumstances, as well as being open and inclusive in communication with subordinates. So, I fall under the undecided category, recognizing both the importance of having a clear answer and the need to be adaptable and inclusive in today's fast-paced business environment."

As a 25-year-old female employee in a mid-sized company in Johannesburg, I know that it's unrealistic to expect a manager to have the answers to every question that may arise.
