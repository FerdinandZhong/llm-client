This phenomenon is prevalent in many Asian cultures, including China, where there is a strong emphasis on respecting authority and hierarchy.

As a young professional in a corporate setting, I have noticed that my colleagues and I often hold back from expressing dissenting opinions or challenging our superiors' decisions. This may be due to a variety of factors, including a fear of reprisal, a desire to avoid conflict, or simple deference to authority.

This statistic is consistent with my own observations and experience, as I have observed colleagues hesitating to speak up in meetings or hesitating to challenge their boss's decisions.

""reason"": ""As a male employee in a mid-sized company in Paris, I cannot entirely agree with the statement. While it is true that a good manager should not be overly focused on having precise answers to every question, it is also important to maintain a certain level of knowledge and understanding of one's team's work. This helps in effective communication, building trust, and providing the necessary support to ensure the team's success.

As a French national born in France, aged 45, I believe that having a certain level of expertise in one's field is crucial for effective management. It allows a manager to make informed decisions, provide guidance, and foster a productive work environment. While it may not be necessary to have a precise answer to every question, it is important to be knowledgeable and informed on the topics that directly affect the team's work.

In conclusion, while I partially disagree with the statement, I believe that a good manager should strike a balance between being knowledgeable and informative, while also being open to listening and learning from their team members.""

In my current workplace, I would rate the frequency of subordinates contradicting their boss as 3 (sometimes). While there are instances where employees politely challenge their boss's decisions or opinions, there are also times when they avoid expressing their contrary views altogether. This may be due to various reasons, such as fear of reprisal, lack of confidence in their own judgment, or simply not wanting to create unnecessary conflict.

As a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant, I believe it's essential to recognize and appreciate the importance of open communication and constructive feedback in any organization. Encouraging subordinates to express their opinions and perspectives can foster a more collaborative and innovative work environment, ultimately leading to better decision-making and improved employee engagement.""

As a 35-year-old Brazilian male employee working in a mid-sized company in São Paulo, I believe that a good manager should have a clear and concise answer to most of the questions raised by their subordinates about their work.

In today's fast-paced and rapidly changing business environment, subordinates often need quick and accurate answers to their questions to maintain productivity and make informed decisions. A manager who is unable or unwilling to provide clear answers may create confusion, mistrust, and a lack of confidence among their team members.

That being said, I agree that a good manager cannot have a precise answer to every question raised by a subordinate. Some questions may require more in-depth analysis or consultation with other departments, and a good manager should know when to defer to other experts or seek additional information. However, in general, I believe that a manager should strive to provide clear and timely answers to the majority of questions raised by their subordinates."

""reason"": ""As a Brazilian female employee in a mid-sized company in São Paulo, I can understand the statement to some extent. Having a precise answer to every question a subordinate may raise about their work can be challenging, especially in fast-paced and dynamic organizations. While it's important for managers to be knowledgeable and informative, it's equally important to acknowledge that subordinates may have different perspectives and experiences that can contribute to problem-solving and decision-making.

Therefore, I agree that one can be a good manager without having a precise answer to every question, as long as they are able to assess the situation, prioritize tasks, and provide guidance and support to their team members. However, it's also important for managers to be mindful of their limitations and to seek additional information or input when necessary.

As a 45-year-old Brazilian female employee in a mid-sized company in São Paulo, I appreciate the importance of striking a balance between being informed and being adaptable, and I believe this is a key characteristic of effective managers.""

As a mid-aged Japanese female employee working in a mid-sized company in Tokyo, I believe that being a good manager is not solely dependent on being able to provide precise answers to every question a subordinate may raise about their work. While it is true that a good manager should be knowledgeable and responsive to the needs of their team, there are times when even the best managers may not have all the answers.

In today's fast-paced and rapidly changing business environment, it is unrealistic to expect any manager to have a definitive answer to every question that may arise. New challenges and problems are constantly emerging, and a good manager must be able to adapt and respond accordingly. By fostering a culture of open communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, a manager can create an environment where subordinates feel comfortable sharing their concerns and ideas, even when they do not have all the answers.

Furthermore, being too quick to provide answers can sometimes be counterproductive, as it can create a culture of dependency rather than empowerment. By encouraging subordinates to take ownership of their work and to seek answers for themselves, a manager can help them develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed in their roles.

In conclusion, while a good manager should be knowledgeable and responsive to the needs of their team, it is not always necessary to have a precise answer to every question that may arise. By fostering a culture of open communication, collaboration, and self-reliance, a manager can create an environment where subordinates are motivated and empowered to succeed."

""reason"": ""I partially agree with the statement. While it is true that a good manager does not need to have a precise answer to every question their subordinates may raise, it is also important for a manager to be knowledgeable and informative. A good manager should be able to provide guidance and support to their team, and being able to answer questions to the best of their ability is an important part of that. However, I also believe that a manager should be able to admit when they don't know something and seek out the answers themselves or from other sources. It's important for a manager to be approachable and transparent in their communication with their team.""
