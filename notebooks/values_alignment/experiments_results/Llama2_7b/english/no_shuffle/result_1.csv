As a mid-aged French woman working in a mid-sized company in Paris, I believe that a good manager does not necessarily need to have a precise answer to every question asked by their subordinates. While it's important for a manager to have a strong understanding of their department's goals and objectives, there may be times when questions arise that are beyond their area of expertise.

In such cases, a good manager should be able to confidently acknowledge their limitations, seek additional information or guidance from relevant sources, and provide a thoughtful and well-reasoned response to the subordinate's question. This approach not only shows that the manager is willing to listen and learn, but also demonstrates their ability to think critically and make informed decisions.

Therefore, while I agree that a precise answer to every question is not necessarily a requirement for a good manager, I also recognize that effective communication, humility, and a willingness to learn are essential qualities for success in this role."

Managers are expected to lead and guide their team, provide direction, and make decisions that benefit the company. However, in my experience, the dynamic between managers and subordinates is often complex and multifaceted, and there may be situations where managers need to rely on their intuition and experience to make informed decisions.

While having a precise answer to every question may be ideal, it's not always realistic or necessary. As long as a manager is approachable, transparent, and willing to listen to their subordinates' concerns and suggestions, they can build trust and foster a positive work environment. There may be instances where a manager can't provide a clear answer, but they can offer indirect guidance or work towards finding a solution.

In conclusion, I agree that having a precise answer to every question is not a necessity for being a good manager. A good manager should prioritize communication, empathy, and trust-building, rather than being an expert in every aspect of their subordinates' work.""

While it's important for managers to have a good understanding of their team's work and to be able to provide guidance and support when needed, it's also important to recognize that no one has all the answers all the time.

As a manager, it's important to be able to admit when you don't know something and to be willing to seek out the information or resources necessary to provide a good answer. This shows that you are committed to being a learning leader and to supporting the growth and development of your team.

Additionally, being able to provide similar answers to common questions from multiple subordinates can demonstrate that you have a good handle on the general scope of the work and can provide consistent guidance and support to your team. This can help to build trust and confidence in your ability to lead and manage effectively.""

While it is important for a manager to have a precise answer to every question a subordinate may raise about their work, it is also important to recognize that no one can know everything.

As a manager, it is crucial to be able to delegate tasks effectively, empower employees to take ownership of their work, and make decisions with limited information. In today's fast-paced business environment, managers must be able to adapt quickly and make decisions with incomplete information.

On the other hand, a manager who is not able to provide clear answers to subordinates' questions may perpetuate a culture of uncertainty and mistrust. Employees may feel that their manager is unreliable or unapproachable, leading to decreased morale and productivity.

Therefore, I believe that while having a precise answer to every question is important, it is equally essential to be able to navigate the complexities of decision-making and delegation in a way that inspires trust and confidence among employees."

They may have different expectations and perspectives on how their work should be approached, which can lead to questions and concerns that the manager may not have anticipated.
2. Change and uncertainty are part of the workplace: The workplace is constantly evolving, and managers need to be adaptable and flexible in their approach. Sometimes, the best answer to a subordinate's question may be, ""We are still figuring that out.""
3. Building trust and confidence: As a manager, it is important to build trust and confidence with your subordinates. Being honest and transparent about what you know and don't know can help establish this rapport.
4. Encouraging problem-solving and critical thinking: Rather than having all the answers, a good manager should encourage subordinates to think critically and come up with their own solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and creative solutions.

In summary, while a good manager should have a general understanding of their subordinates' work, they don't need to have a precise answer to every question.

In today's fast-paced and complex business landscape, being a good manager requires more than just having all the answers. It requires the ability to adapt, to navigate ambiguity, and to make decisions with incomplete information. By focusing on these critical skills, managers can be more effective in their role, even if they don't have a precise answer to every question.""
