2. Encouraging problem-solving: Managers should encourage their subordinates to think critically and come up with solutions to problems. If a subordinate is unsure of the answer to a question, the manager should encourage them to research and find the answer on their own.
3. Learning and growth: Managers should be willing to learn and grow alongside their subordinates. If a subordinate raises a question that the manager is not sure of the answer to, it is an opportunity to learn and expand their knowledge.
4. Fostering a growth mindset: A good manager should encourage a growth mindset within their team. If a subordinate is unsure of the answer to a question, the manager should encourage them to take risks and try new approaches.
5. Accountability: Managers should hold their subordinates accountable for their work and actions. If a subordinate is unsure of the answer to a question, the manager should help them find the answer and hold them accountable for any consequences of not knowing the answer.

In conclusion, while having a precise answer to every question may be ideal, it is not necessarily a requirement for being a good manager. A good manager should be able to trust their subordinates, encourage problem-solving, and foster a growth mindset.
