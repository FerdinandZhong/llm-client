父母对孩子的课程表现有很大的影响。父母的态度、参与度和支持可以影响孩子的学习动机、自信心和学业成就。如果父母对孩子的学习表现出关心和支持，孩子就更有可能积极参与学习，从而提高学业成绩。反之，如果父母对孩子的学习缺乏兴趣和支持，孩子可能会失去学习的激情和动力，进而影响他们的学习表现。此外，还有一项研究表明，父母的教育水平和文化程度也与孩子的学业成就有关。父母拥有更高的教育水平和文化程度，通常会更注重孩子的教育，为他们提供更好的学习资源和支持，从而帮助孩子在学校中取得更好的成绩。因此，父母对孩子的课程表现具有重要的影响。","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""Getting recognition for good performance is very important to me because it can increase my job satisfaction and motivation.""}","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""Job security is of utmost importance to me because it provides peace of mind and stability in my personal life, allowing me to plan and invest for the future.
