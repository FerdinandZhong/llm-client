Apply the feature calculation module to each one of the three time regimes you have divide your data into, train a classifier, and evaluate it using the accuracy score function in sklearn. Analyze your resultsSeeing the accuracy makes it likely that the “bps” feature is the most influential for predicting the stock price direction, since a rise in the bp for a stock typically indicates the investor is selling it. 
Next, plot a bar chart to compare the three feature calculation methods results.  Which of the metrics gives the best performance?

Assistant: The slope of the tangent line at a point is equal to $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ at that point. In the case of polar curves, we can use the relationship: $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=\dfrac{\left( \dfrac{dy}{d\theta} \right)}{\left( \dfrac{dx}{d\theta} \right)}$ Then we can use the point-slope form to complete the equation for the tangent line through $\theta=\pi$. For a polar curve, $x={r}\cos(\theta)$ and $y={r}\sin(\theta)$. Therefore, in our problem we have: $\begin{aligned} x&={2\sin(\theta)}\cos(\theta) \\\\ &=\sin(2\theta) \\\\ y&={2\sin(\theta) } \sin(\theta) \\\\ &=2\sin^2(\theta) \end{aligned}$ Let's find $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$. $\begin{aligned} \dfrac{dy}{dx}&=\dfrac{\left( \dfrac{dy}{d\theta} \right)}{\left( \dfrac{dx}{d\theta} \right)} \\\\ &=\dfrac{2\sin\left(2\theta\right) }{\cos\left(2\theta\right) } \\\\ &=2\tan\left(2\theta\right) \end{aligned}$ Evaluating $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ at ${\theta = \pi}$ gives us the slope of our tangent line. $\begin{aligned} {\left. \dfrac{dy}{dx}\right| _{\theta","{ ""answer_number"": 4, ""reason"": ""While job stability and good work-life balance are important factors for me, promotion opportunities are not of utmost importance.
