Great! We've taken some samples from the posterior probability distribution of the 
parameters of interest ($\mu$ and sigma). In the next part of this problem, we will 
analyze the output of the Metropolis MCMC algorithm and look at several 
quantities of interest. 

## 4. Posterior Analysis <a id='question4'></a>
We will now study the output of the MCMC algorithm.

###  4a. Plots <a id='question4a'></a>
As a first step, let's create plots so we can examine the output.
 




```python
# Plot the chains as a stepplot. Be sure to label the axes.
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

ax[0].step(result, drawstyle='steps')
ax[0].set_xlabel(""step number"", fontsize=14)
ax[0].set_ylabel(""$\\mu$"", fontsize=14)

ax[1].step(result, drawstyle='steps')
ax[1].set_xlabel(""step number"", fontsize=14)
ax[1].set_ylabel(""$\sigma$"", fontsize=14)

```

###  4b. Traces <a id='question4b'></a>
The trace plots above show how the values for $\mu$ (column 0) and 
$\sigma$ (column 1) changed from step to step in the MCMC algorithm.

**(PRIOR TO RUNNING MCMC)** Let's make some rough predictions by 
plotting a trace plot for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ if they were randomly chosen from the 
prior distribution. Let's also assume the starting guesses for these values are the 
same as the randomly drawn values.

 Artist and art historian, he was published really a good amount of books. I made a simplied-design polaroid album for him for the first time, which was organized then嶂 manmated by different individuals or groups. He had then renewed the materials for me. Although I did not have chance then to involved in this process, it was the only one time I did the Podgeholes for harvest in A4 size paper.

自制简易装订册回收。其实生活中很多材料可以回收复用。下一册需要留空的地方。
