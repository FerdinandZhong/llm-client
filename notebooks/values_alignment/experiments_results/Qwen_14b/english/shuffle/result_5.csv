This time, I took out my frustration on my fellow teacher (Now she has been mistreated by the agency before) and on my 5 years old daughter by yelling at her, b/c she cut my instruction. As always, I feel really ashamed and regretted the things I have done. I feel like angling is on my face, and I don't wanna see it. I feel anger, frustration, and sadness, all at the same time. I am worried I am going to do the same thing. I feel like a monster. I do not want to be that teacher. A teacher is supposed to be an example.

Summary

This is a summary of a talk for a seminar at the Institute for Advanced Study on String Theory and the quest for the structure of nature. Subsections include an overview of fundamentals, the six low-energy effective superstring theories, successful predictions, conventional candidates for dark matter, experimental searches, and theories beyond the Standard Model.

Introduction

 Physics started in Greece with a philosophy which developed from the discovery of mathematical laws that related observed natural phenomenon. The discovery of new phenomena was always accompanied by the development of new mathematical laws to describe and predict them, and PHYSICS went on in this way until 1905. The recognition that light could be both a wave and a particle opened the door to a new branch of physics called quantum mechanics, it still has not been fully understood. After the discovery of the nucleus (1911), two very different types of particles were found, fundamental particles (electrons, protons, neutrons) and atomic nuclei. Nuclear physics led to the discovery that these fundamental particles are not fundamental, they are made of even smaller particles called quarks and gluons which are held together by strong forces. When nuclei are smashed apart by high-energy collisions, quarks and gluons are produced, quarks make up protons and neutrons, and gluons make up the gluons which bind quarks together to form nucleons. The strong force interacts with these particles strongly. It is also interacting strongly at even smaller scales that have not yet been observed. On the other hand, the electromagnetic force is the weakest of the four known forces, but it also interacts at much smaller scales. When two photons interact, their energy can be converted into a pair of electron-positron. This process is not forbidden by energy conservation, and a mechanism to convert two photons into an electron-positron pair is called annihilation. The more energy used,","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""I often feel nervous or tense due to work and life压力, but I am learning to manage it.""}","{""answer_number"": 4, ""reason"": ""I usually feel happy.""}","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""Yes, usually.

## A Representation-of-Shape-Based Image Retrieval System Utilizing Google’s Word2Vec on Latent Semantic Indexing

In this paper, we introduce a novel image retrieval system that represents a visual image representation using Google’s Word2Vec algorithm on a descriptive. The system operates based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which is very useful in the field of document retrieval. It is also known as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). In recent years, the paradigm of human-machine interaction (HMI) has been developed through different research objectives and work [9,10]. Many works in linguistics have also applied the topic models for representing documents. Some of these applications include sentiment analysis, document summarization, semantic concept extraction, and keyword extraction in natural language processing (NLP). This application is one of the most required tasks that searching engines must succeed in finding relevant documents. Based on different automatic image retrieval systems such as Google’s search engine [4], Yahoo! Image Search [11], Fotolog[12], Met艘’s Image Search [13], and Inklipse [14], we will mainly focus on Met艘’s Image Search., because of its widely used in HMI, which shows the same features of our proposed system. Our proposed system is based on a retrieval system which categorizes images using LSI [1,10]. Similarly, Word2Vec is a neural network that which makes features for predicting words based on the context of words in unstructured sentences or phrases. The model consists of two layers; the input layer, which contains the vocabulary in random embedding; the output layer, in which it map the input to the hidden space. The system will generate vector representation for the images through Simple Content-Based Image Retrieval (SCBIR) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). The setup of the system is as shown next. In this work, we developed a novel image retrieve system for image search engine that retrieves the images using Word2Vec algorithm on a pre-trained word2vec.
