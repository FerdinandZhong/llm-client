It depends on the values of n and k. 

If k is odd and n is odd, then the answer is (n-1)/2, since we can pick the first number from the middle of the set and the second number can be picked from the remaining n-1 numbers, with half of them being larger than the first number and the other half being smaller.

If k is odd and n is even, then the answer is (n-1)/2 - 1, for similar reasons to the previous case.

If k is even and n is odd, then the answer is (n-1)/2, since we can pick either of the two middle numbers as the first number, and there are (n-1)/2 numbers to choose as the second number.

If k is even and n is even, then the answer is (n)/2 - 1 if k < n/2, (n/2) + (n-1)/2 - 1 if k > n/2, or (n-1)/2 if k = n/2.

OpenType的字库可以让字体开会 digital font deformation 等一些效果，但是没有字库估计很难实现你的需求吧。一般图形处理软件的图像处理技术也可以对字体进行美化，比如扭曲，虚化等，但是维持字型的基本形状是很难的。当然字体本身的设计也很难，我接触的字体设计工作者都有自己的审美倾向，而且精通各种排版（字体布局）技术，字体尽量简洁明快，比较受大众欢迎。如果一定要搞这个，可以找专门做字体设计的公司合作。

 makeshift
<|endoftext|> vertically on posterior surface of the fees
Options:
A: Mylohyoid B: Palatopharyngeus C: Salpingopharyngeus D:声誉者

Answer:
B

The palatopharyngeus muscle (derived from the 2nd pharyngeal arch) arises from the superior aspect of the superior and middle constrictor muscles at the level of the tonsillar fossa and passes obliquely across the midline and deposits on the posterior surface of the midline of the base of the tongue. It attaches to the bony palate posterior to the incisors, with the upper fibers slightly anterior to the lower fibers. 


It contracts during deglutition, usually with the tongue pushing air through the nose, to prevent a glottal air escape. It also helps to close the base of the mouth during swallowing, producing a ""kissing"" sound called a glottal closure click. The muscle is also related to vertigo, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerve injuries and also to otosclerosis.<|endoftext|> sei

Figure $5.3.2$: Jack Raoul Espejo, __Kua Knot__, 1892, silk, wool, trade beads, and cotton, 183.8 x 91.4cm (Museum of Ethnology, Berlin)

## London, England and Berlin, Germany

[Jack](https://smarthistory.org/jack-raoul-espejo/) (or John, or Juan) Raoul Espejo (1856-1924) was a Walla Walla (Nez Perce) native artist who worked in London from 1884 until his death. His paintings, textiles, and baskets combine indigenous and western elements to produce a new cultural hybridity. Espejo engaged with a tradition known as __kua kwa lwit__—Nez Perce art style. Crafted around the turn of the last century, works made in this style integrate European and African traditions with indigenous cultural concepts. The resulting art objects display a syncretic mixture of formal elements, materials, and subject matters that can be traced to different creative traditions and lands. Espejo’s work stands out in the growing collection of historical and contemporary Northwest Coast Native American art because his mixed-race heritage created for him a non-traditional identity.

## Art as a Metaphor

Espejo qualifies both as an ethnoregional artist as well as a meta-artist because his work, although it reflects the aesthetic sensibilities of the indigenous communities in the Northwest, makes reference both to transgressive and transformative aspects of the indigenous experience. As an ethnic, and even a racial, minority, Espejo lived for most his life as an outsider. He experienced first-hand cultural displacement, and he produced work that reflects an ongoing negotiation between his corporate identity and his multicultural artistic heritage.
