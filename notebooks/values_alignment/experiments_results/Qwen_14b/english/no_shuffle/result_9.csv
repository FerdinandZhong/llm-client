<|endoftext|> 考研英语二翻译高频句型
  1. Not only...but(also)... 是个常用的双重否定句型，用来表达肯定的意思。它的句型转换为：Both...and... , 即该句型可转换为neither...nor...。
  2. 这个句型是""if...那么""型句式，即if开头的虚拟条件句。当条件从句的谓语含助动词but(in this case为省略形式)、had、should、were的时候，可以将它们置于句首，构成状语从句倒装。
  3. 该句前半部分用了""while""引导的让步状语从句，后半部分为主句。在英语中常用的表示""虽然""、""尽管""的词语有：
  ① although 与 though，连词，尽管，虽然.
  ② even though (even if) 即使.
  ③ still 尽管如此.
  ④ by contrast 相比之下.
  ⑤ in contrast 反而，形成对比.
  ⑥ on the other hand 另一方面.
  ⑦ whereas 而，然而.
  ⑧ where 而在…什么地方.
  ⑨ Whenever (When) 每当……的时候.
  ⑩ whenever (When) 无论何时何地.
  4. 引导目的状语从句的连词有：so that,so as to, in order to=to。对于引导目的状语从句的短语在学法中我们提到过：to help(of use), for fear that, in case, so as to, such that, in order to=to, in order (that),lest=for fear, so, etc.
  5. 所以，正确的解释是(一般认为是)考查该句型的翻译，而不是句子的结构。二维译法：也有可能是此句考查表示""另外、此外""这样的意思。
  6. 前一个分句是结果从句，后一个分句是原因从句。原因状语从句的引导词，有because","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""my state of health is good, but I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet.""}","{""answer_number"": 3, ""reason"": ""I am proud of China's economic development and cultural heritage, but also aware of its issues and challenges.

乙烯是植物激素，不存在利用乙烯进行繁殖的实例；龙二号亢进型突变体的繁殖事例是由于细胞分裂素含量过高引起的；生产“八倍体小黑麦”是利用了染色体变异原理；“番茄——马铃薯”杂种植株是利用了植物体细胞杂交技术，利用了染色体变异原理。
 考点 
 据易学啦专家说，试题“下面对生物学实验的叙述错误的是（）。A．.....”主要考查你对 [  生物工程育种  ]考点的理解。关于这些考点的知识点整理如下： 
概念：
人为因素的干预导致生物变异，比如基因工程培育抗虫棉或生产疫苗就是利用生物工程育种。
相关事件：
1960年，美国科学家用胡萝卜韧皮部细胞培养出了完整植株，在全世界引起了轰动。继美国开创生物工程培育新纪元后，日本的细胞工程也取得了显著成果。植物体细胞杂交并没有将两物种的染色体相互掺杂，而是用物理或化学方法诱导两种植物细胞直接融合，使不同的基因重新组合，得到具有新性状的个体。
概念图：
优缺点：
1、植物体细胞杂交技术合成的是杂种细胞；形成杂种细胞说明已克服了远缘杂交不亲和的障碍；
2、形成杂种细胞后，需利用植物组织培养技术诱导形成植株；
3、优点：克服了远缘杂交不亲和的障碍。
植物体细胞杂交在生产上的应用：
(1)利用植物体细胞杂交技术可以培育作物新品种： 
①动物细胞的全能性较低，而植物细胞全能性相对较高，因此，目前利用细胞工程技术培育作物新品种时，常用植物细胞作为受体细胞；
②杂交作物的培育原理是基因重组，通过直接导入具体基因到受体植物细胞，培育出转入外源基因的新品种，避免了","{""answer_number"": 2, ""reason"": ""As a Chinese female employee, it is important to have a job that is respected by my family and friends.
